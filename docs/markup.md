# Markup

Prettify supports beautification of markup type languages with extended support for the template language Liquid. The algorithm Prettify employs was adapted from 2 respected tools, Sparser and PrettyDiff originally written by Austin Cheney. Both these tools were overhauled for usage within Prettify but respect to the original approaches employed in terms of the generated data structure produced by Sparser lexers and the parse handling of PrettyDiff.

# Rules

The markup beautification options (rules) are granular.
