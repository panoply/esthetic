# Language Support

Below is a current support list of supported languages, their completion status and whether you can run Æsthetic for beautification. You can leverage on languages above 90% completion, anything below that is not yet ready for the big time. Languages with an above 80% completion status will work with basic structures, but may not be viable in some cases and can be problematic.
