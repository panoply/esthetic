# Motivation

Code beautification is essential to the development experience. Seeing code adhere to an intended structure without the need for manual intervention is a programming pleasantry that most of us tend to take for granted nowadays. Writing a formatter is not something many developers would be interested in creating and that is fair because it is an exhausting undertaking but to quote the great Cus D`Amato:

##### "When a person’s interested in something, they’re willing to tolerate any kind of problems that may come up."

Æsthetic was originally developed to handle chaotic and unpredictable Liquid + HTML markup structures for the [vscode-liquid](https://liquify.dev) extension. Before creating Æsthetic, there was no solution or tools available which supported Liquid infused syntax and developers working with the this template language were unable to leverage beautifiers. This was the accepted status-quo until [Austin Cheney](https://github.com/prettydiff) made the impossible, possible and shipped support for Liquid beautification in Sparser and PrettyDiff.

## The Evolution of Open Source

Upon the initial implementation of Sparser and PrettyDiff into the [vscode-liquid](https://liquify.dev) it quickly become apparent that a more focused and fluid solution was required but both these tools had been abandoned and as of 2019 were no longer being _actively_ maintained. Having grown fond and accustomed to the generated output of PrettyDiff I began sifting through the codebase to fix a couple defects but quickly became fascinated with the overall architecture of these tools and their parse algorithm written by [Austin Cheney](https://github.com/prettydiff).

Minor refactors, turned into major refactors and several months later the projects had morphed into Æsthetic.

## Opinions are Oppression

Æsthetic uses the developers intent and refines its result in accordance. This approach allows developers to determine what works best for a project at hand.
