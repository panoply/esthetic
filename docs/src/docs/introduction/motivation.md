# Motivation

Æsthetic was originally developed to handle chaotic and unpredictable Liquid + HTML markup structures. Before creating Æsthetic, there was no solution or tool available which supported Liquid infused syntax and developers working on projects using the template language were unable to leverage beautifiers. This became the accepted status-quo until [Austin Cheney](https://github.com/prettydiff) support for Liquid beautification in Sparser and PrettyDiff.

The scale of the Sparser project and its parse algorithm was always an ambitious undertaking and before its retirement in 2019, [Austin](https://github.com/prettydiff) was overseeing support for over **40** different languages. Focusing attention to edge-cases pertaining to a template language is rightfully not the most pressing of tasks in a project of that size.

## The Evolution of Open Source

become apparent that a more focused and fluid solution was required but both these tools had been abandoned and as of 2019 were no longer being _actively_ maintained. Having grown fond and accustomed to the generated output of PrettyDiff I began sifting through the codebase to fix a couple defects but quickly became fascinated with the overall architecture of these tools and their parse algorithm written by [Austin Cheney](https://github.com/prettydiff).

Minor refactors, turned into major refactors and several months later the projects had morphed into Æsthetic.

## Opinions are Oppression

Æsthetic uses the developers intent and refines its result in accordance. This approach allows developers to determine what works best for a project at hand.
