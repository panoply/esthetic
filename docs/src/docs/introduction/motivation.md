# Motivation

Æsthetic was originally developed to handle chaotic and unpredictable Liquid + HTML markup structures for the [vscode-liquid](https://liquify.dev) extension. Before creating Æsthetic, alternative solutions did not support Liquid infused syntax and thus developers using the Liquid template language were not able to leverage beautifiers.

## Evolutionary Open Source

I discovered Sparser and PrettyDiff while seeking a solution to this problem and together they supported Liquid formatting but they had unfortunately fallen into disarray and as of 2019 were no longer being _actively_ maintained. I began sifting through the code in an attempt to breath some new life into the captivating projects and was fascinated with the universal parse algorithm that author [Austin Cheney](https://github.com/prettydiff) created and employed.

## Opinions are Opression

Æsthetic uses the developers intent and refines its result in accordance. This approach allows developers to determine what works best for a project at hand.
