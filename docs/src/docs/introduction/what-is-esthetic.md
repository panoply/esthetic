# What is Æsthetic?

Æsthetic is a lightweight, fast and extensible code beautification tool that exists as an alternative to [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [JS Beautify](https://beautifier.io/). It currently provides formatting support for front-end orientated client side languages. Æsthetic implements a variation of the universal [Sparser](https://sparser.io/docs-html/tech-documentation.xhtml#universal-parse-model) lexing algorithm and has been adapted from the distributed source of [PrettyDiff](https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff/blob/master/options.md).

Æsthetic provides parse, format and language detection capabilities with support for **10** different languages:

- Liquid
- HTML
- XML
- CSS
- SCSS
- JSON
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- JSX
- TSX

# Why Æsthetic?

Æsthetic is little different from other formatters in the nexus. The parse approach it implements is an original strategic concept that produces a uniformed table like structure which allows for otherwise complex structures to be traversed and interpreted for handling without having to bend and augment sequencing to address weaknesses. The data structure generated is a refined uniform array comprised of identifiable types, characters sequences and stack references which make sense of the code input provided. The parse table is used to reconstruct code during the beautification cycle and adhere to the granular set of beautification that work in accordance with the developers intent.
