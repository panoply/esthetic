# Acknowledgements

Æsthetic owes its existence to [Sparser](https://sparser.io/) and [PrettyDiff](https://prettydiff.com/). This project has been adapted from these 2 brilliant tools and while largely refactored + overhauled the original parse architecture remains intact. Building a code beautification tool is not easy, there are many hurdles and paradigms to overcome, many tests cases to execute against and problems that occur. Development on Æsthetic began in 2022 and despite having Sparser and PrettyDiff lay the foundation, a lot of time has gone into it's reapplication. Some acknowledgements are owed to several individuals who have helped make Æsthetic a reality by contributing their time, thoughts and suggestions.

### [Austin Cheney](https://github.com/prettydiff)

Austin is the original author of PrettyDiff and Sparser. He has since created [Shared File Systems](https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems) which is a privacy first point-to-point communication tool. Please check it out and also have a read of
[wisdom](https://github.com/prettydiff/wisdom) which personally helped me become a better developer.

### [David Warrington](#)

Dave is a senior software engineer working with Shopify. Dave is behind a lot of the developer facing logic in Æsthetic, especially Liquid and Markup related handling and control vectors. Check out his [blog](https://ellodave.dev).

### [Mansedan](#)

Mansedan has been leveraging Æsthetic since its conception. His insights, suggestions and real-world usage has allowed for Æsthetic to reach stability. Mansedan runs a Discord server for Shopify Developers and acts on behalf of internationally recognized brands in the e-commerce nexus.

### [Max Design](#)

Max was able to provide Æsthetic with fundamental suggestions and without his thoughts and contributions, a lot of rules would not exist. Max has vigorously tested Æsthetic and allowed edge cases to be handled gracefully by providing complex structures during the alpha and beta releases.

### [PrettyDiff](https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff) and [Sparser](https://github.com/unibeautify/sparser)

Æsthetic is made possible because of the [Austin Cheney](https://github.com/prettydiff) who is the original author of [Sparser](https://github.com/unibeautify/sparser) and [PrettyDiff](https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff). Austin is one of the great minds in JavaScript and I want to thank him for open sourcing these tools.

Both PrettyDiff and Sparser were retired in 2019 after a nearly a decade of production. Austin has since created [Shared File Systems](https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems) which is a privacy first point-to-point communication tool. Please check it out and also have a read of
[wisdom](https://github.com/prettydiff/wisdom) which personally helped me become a better developer.
