# CLI

Æsthetic provides CLI support via the `esthetic` command and assumes configuration has defined within your projects `package.json` file on the `esthetic` property. CLI usage requires a paths/patterns be provided which will resolve from the path location the command was invoked. By default, Æsthetic will print formatted code to `stdout` unless the `-f` or `--format` flag was passed.
