# Delimiter Terminus

Whether or not ending HTML tag delimiters should be forced onto a newline. This will emulate the style of Prettier's `singleAttributePerLine` formatting option, wherein the last `>` delimiter character breaks itself onto a new line. Though this output style was popularized by Prettier, the resulting structures produced are far from elegant (aesthetically).

#### 👍 &nbsp;&nbsp; Disabled

_Below is the default, which does not force ending delimiters `>` onto newlines in tags containing attributes._

```html
<div id="x" class="xx">
  <div id="x" class="xx"></div>
</div>
```

#### 👎 &nbsp;&nbsp; Enabled

_Below is an example of how this rule works if it's enabled, ie: `true`. Notice how the ending delimiters are forced onto newlines._

```html
<div id="x" class="xx">
  <div id="x" class="xx"></div>
</div>
```
