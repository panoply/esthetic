#### Quote Convert

How quotation characters of markup attributes and Liquid tokens should be handled. Allows for conversion to single quotes or double quotes. Markup tag attributes should always use double quotations, it's the standard in languages like HTML.

#### Tip

When working with Liquid, use `single` quotes for strings and always infer `double` in the markup.
