# Rules

Æsthetic provides a granular set of beautification options (rules). The projects [Typings](https://github.com/panoply/esthetic/tree/pre-release/types/rules) explains in good detail the effect each available rule has on code. You can also checkout the [Playground](https://liquify.dev/Æsthetic) to get a better idea of how code will be beautified.
