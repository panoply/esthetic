**Default** `false`

💁🏽‍♀️ &nbsp;&nbsp; Recommended setting is: `false`

Automatically correct some sloppiness in code and allow Prettify to reason with the intended structures in order to reduce chaos in otherwise unreadable and terrible code like that you'd find in Shopify's Dawn theme. The option acts as a very mild form of linting, wherein invalid code will be attempt to be corrected.

The option enables Prettify to go about fixing your shitty code. It's not going to produce miracles and for the most part it will have little effect overall but can help in some situations.
