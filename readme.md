The new generation code beautification tool for formatting HTML, Liquid, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and more! √Üsthetic leverages the [Sparser](https://sparser.io/docs-html/tech-documentation.xhtml#universal-parse-model) lexing algorithm and its parse approach has been repurposed from the distributed source of the late and powerful [PrettyDiff](https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff/blob/master/options.md).

### Documentation

# Acknowledgements

√Üsthetic owes its existence to Sparser and PrettyDiff. This project has been adapted from these 2 brilliant tools and while largely refactored + overhauled the original parse architecture remains intact.

### [PrettyDiff](https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff) and [Sparser](https://github.com/unibeautify/sparser)

√Üsthetic is made possible because of the [Austin Cheney](https://github.com/prettydiff) who is the original author of [Sparser](https://github.com/unibeautify/sparser) and [PrettyDiff](https://github.com/prettydiff/prettydiff). Austin is one of the great minds in JavaScript and I want to thank him for open sourcing these tools.

Both PrettyDiff and Sparser were retired in 2019 after a nearly a decade of production. Austin has since created [Shared File Systems](https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems) which is a privacy first point-to-point communication tool. Please check it out and also have a read of
[wisdom](https://github.com/prettydiff/wisdom) which personally helped me become a better developer.
