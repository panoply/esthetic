**Default** `false`

💁🏽‍♀️ &nbsp;&nbsp; Recommended setting is: `false`

Whether or not to format regions of code that are identified to be JSON. Tags such as `<script type="application/json">` and `{% schema %}` can contain JSON and by default beautification is applied using the `json` rules. When ignored (ie: `true`) Prettify will not apply formatting to these regions.
