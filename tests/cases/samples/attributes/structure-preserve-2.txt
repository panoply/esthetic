Testing Liquid attribute structures which will conditionally output attributes. The expressions will remain intact, with the `id=foo` being inlined. The `{% if x %}`, `{% elsif %}` will be preserved as per expression.

---

<div

id="foo"
{% if x  %}data-attr="x"
{% elsif %}
data-id="x"{% endif %}

></div>
